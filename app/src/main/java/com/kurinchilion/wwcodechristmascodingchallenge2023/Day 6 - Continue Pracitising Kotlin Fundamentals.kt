/*
* Temperature converter
* There are three main temperature scales used in the world: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
* Write a program that converts a temperature
* from one scale to another with these formulas:
* Celsius to Fahrenheit: 째 F = 9/5 (째 C) + 32
* Kelvin to Celsius: 째 C = K - 273.15
* Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = 5/9 (째 F - 32) + 273.15
* Note that the String.format("%.2f", /* measurement */ ) method is used to convert a number into a
* String type with 2 decimal places.
* Complete the main() function so that it calls the printFinalTemperature() function and prints the
* following lines. You need to pass arguments for the temperature and conversion formula.

* Song catalog
*
* Imagine that you need to create a music-player app.
*
* Create a class that can represent the structure of a song. The Song class must include these code elements:
*
* Properties for the title, artist, year published, and play count
* A property that indicates whether the song is popular. If the play count is less than 1,000, consider it unpopular.
* A method that prints a song description in this format:
